let fs = require('fs');

// npm install @types/node
// Then fs.

Conclusion:

Typescript is a JS superset on top of the latest ECMA standard, with *optional* types

Typescript's main feature is static type checking, benefits:
- Catches errors at compile time, and not runtime
- Exposes auto-completion and code hinting (if you have a good IDE)

-> SAFETY

Integration with Webpack is good:
- works great on client side (React, etc.)
- and server side (express, graphql, etc.)

Many open source projects are using it:
Angular2, RxJS, Phaser, VSCode, Unity

Unlinke Flow, it comes with a transpiler.
What, another layer to transpile you may say?
Well, we already do that to get ES6->ES5 using babel...
